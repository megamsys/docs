Megam Oja is a simple application orchestrator installed in a few commands supporting both vms and containers on baremetal.

#Launching apps
Got a webapp written in *Node.js* or *Ruby on rails* and looking forward to deploy it? Megam Oja makes it seamless to launch apps in just few clicks. Launch node, rails, php, play, java applications in few clicks.

#Launching services
Launch databases to bind them to your application you have launched with the app that is running on megam oja or any other cloud or launch a rabbitmq service to take care of all your message broker needs.

#Continious integration
Commit your code with a new feature or a bug fix and get it updated on the production servers in seconds. It is a pain to update a particular feature once the application is running on the prod servers, with CI, all you need to do is commit the code and you are good to go, within seconds the app is updated and restarted.

#Git
Integration to leading Git repos both public and private . Virtually any Git repo can be integrated (Assembly, Bitbucket, etc..) just let us know we'll get it out for ya. Currently we support Github and Gitlab

#Micro services
Launch docker containers both in VM or as bare metal or coreos. Also monitor and log containers.

#Analytics
Launch analytics using SparkNotebook for development, or on a cluster with custom built templates for prediction is a breeze

#Bulit in logs
Real-time logs to constantly monitor the applications, services and containers.

#Monitoring
Monitoring of all the applications and services with intuitive graphs.
