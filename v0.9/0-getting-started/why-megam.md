The two editions cover everything that you need right from an academy, startup to ISV, SI or ISP.

If you are an ISP (bandwidth guy) and wish to launch a service in your target market we would be glad to help. 

##On premise opensource

If you are running on premise we provide HA, replicated storage on commodity hardware. The HA is re engineered using `CephFS`  as we speak.

## Features

##Migration and scalability is easy.

Become data center ready from day one, which means the on premise version just allows you to add the extra compute storage with no fuss with a simple click.

##Remote Backup

An object based backup using an intuitive UI, dump  your data to your hearts content.

##Launching apps

Got a webapp written in Node.js or Ruby on rails and looking forward to deploy it? Megam  cloud platform makes it seamless to launch apps in just few clicks. Launch node, rails, php,  play, java applications in few clicks.

##Launching services

Launch databases to bind them to your application you have launched with the app that is running on megam cloud platform or any other cloud or launch a rabbitmq service to take care of all your message broker needs. 

##Continuous integration

Commit your code with a new feature or a bug fix and get it  updated on the production servers in seconds.  It is a pain to update a particular feature once the application is running on the prod servers, with CI, all you need to do is commit the code and you are good to go, within seconds the app is updated and restarted. 

## Git

Integration to leading Git repos both public and private . Virtually any Git repo can be integrated (Assembly, Bitbucket, etc..)  just let us know we'll get it out for ya.

##Micro services

Launch docker containers both in VM or as bare metal or coreos. Also monitor and log containers.

##Analytics

Launch analytics using SparkNotebook for development, or on a cluster with custom built templates for prediction is a breeze

##Built in logs

Real-time logs to constantly monitor the applications, services and containers.

##Monitoring

Monitoring of all the applications and services with intuitive graphs.

Lastly an awesome simple documentation :+1: hopefully
