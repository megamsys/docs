#Hellow ! What is SlimBox ?  

SlimBox is a **1 Node** setup with compute, storage, and [Megam Oja](doc:megam_cloudmanagement_intro) built-in.

When we say setting up Slim Box it really means that you are going to setup *one node* as compute/storage - cloud ready  that can run [apps](doc:megam_quick_launch), [service](doc:postgresql), [micro service](doc:megam_docker)  and [analytics](doc:meglytics_intro).

##Steps

The steps  for setting up a  SlimBox are as follows.

* [Bootstrapping Master](doc:megam_slimbox_bootstrap) 
* [Install using MegdC command line tool](doc:megam_megdc_tool)
* [Completing SlimBox](doc:megam_slimbox_complete)
