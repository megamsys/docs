Once you have setup *SlimBox*, as the business need grows you need to launch more apps/service, it time to expand to a *BeeBox*. 

#Hellow ! What is BeeBox ?  

BeeBox is a **2 Node** setup with compute, storage, and Megam built-in. 

When we say setting up Bee Box it really means that you are going to setup two or more nodes as compute/storage - cloud ready that can run [apps](doc:megam_quick_launch), [service](doc:postgresql), [micro service](doc:megam_docker)  and [analytics](doc:meglytics_infro).

Oh Yeah, you'll get it for **free**.
